# Agendas
Just a small project to distract the mind in these challenging times. It consist of adding, editing and removing contacts from an agenda. Still working on the details.

## TODO

### Fix Put Methods in the Controllers

```
When trying to update an existing Contact, it just creates a new one. Maybe add @Version to the model? Need to investigate
```

### Improve the models

```
Add more data to the Contact model (Maybe the others too? :lazy-af:)
```

### Implement i18n

```
Need to learn how to implement internationalization to Spring Boot projects, so this simple project its a good excercise
```

### Other things

```
Implement others things
```
